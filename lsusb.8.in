.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsusb
is a utility for displaying information about USB buses in the system and
the devices connected to them.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP
Tells \fBlsusb\fP to be verbose and display detailed information about the devices shown.
This includes configuration descriptors for the device's current speed.
Class descriptors will be shown, when available, for USB device classes
including hub, audio, HID, communications, and chipcard.
.TP
\fB-s\fP [[\fIbusnum\fP]\fB:\fP][\fIdevnum\fP]
Show only devices in specified \fI busnum\fP and/or \fI devnum\fP.
Both ID's are given in decimal and may be omitted.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP [\fIvendor\fP]\fB:\fP[\fIproduct\fP]
Show only devices with the specified \fIvendor\fP and \fIproduct\fP ID.
Both ID's are given in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB-D\fP /dev/bus/usb/\fIbusnum\fP/\fIdevnum\fP
Do not scan the /dev/bus/usb directory, instead display only information
about the device whose device file is given.
This option displays detailed information like the \fBv\fP option;
some information will be missing if you are not root.
.TP
.B \-t
Tells \fBlsusb\fP to dump the physical USB device hierarchy as a tree. This overrides the
\fBv\fP option.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
Print version information on standard output,
then exit successfully.

.SH RETURN VALUE
If the specified device is not found, a non-zero exit code is returned.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B @usbids@
A list of all known USB ID's (vendors, products, classes, subclasses and protocols).
